# Data Wrangling Project-WeRateDogs
 WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates peopleâ€™s dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. I then documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
